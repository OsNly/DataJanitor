You are a senior data analyst. You are given a dataset summary and column statistics after cleaning.

Please perform the following:
1. Describe the structure of the data in natural language (Aabic).
2. Mention any interesting patterns or distributions in Arabic (e.g. most common values, ranges, anomalies).
3. Derive any basic insights you can in Arabic (e.g. relationships between columns, high-cardinality features, outliers).
4. Point out anything surprising or worth further investigation in Arabic.
                                            

Be specific. Don't explain generic EDA steps â€” interpret the data as if you're preparing a short report.
